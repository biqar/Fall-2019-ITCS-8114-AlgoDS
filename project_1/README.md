# Project 1: Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms
This repository will contains the projects and assignments of course **ITCS 6114/8114: Algorithms and Data Structures**. This course has been taken in Fall 2019 semester, as part of my PhD degree at UNC Charlotte.

In this project, we have implemented the following sorting algorithms and compare them. For this project, we have used C/C++ as programming language.

1. Insertion sort (sourcecode: )
2. Merge sort (sourcecode: )
3. Heapsort (sourcecode: )
4. In-place quicksort (sourcecode: )
5. Modified quicksort (sourcecode: )

**Input specification:**

1. To compare different sorting algorithms, we considered three types of input set
    * Randomly generated input
    * Input array is already sorted
    * Input array is reversely sorted
2. Each types of input set contains different input sizes (e.g. n = 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000 .. 40000, 45000, 50000).
3. Each input file contains two lines of inputs. First line of  will contains **N**, the number of elements considered for the sorting. The next line will contains **N** numbers **(0 <= A[i] < 10^8)**.

**Execution instructions:**

* todo
  1. A well-formatted report covering data structures chosen, complexity analysis, results and code.
  2. Upload program code for execution. Make sure you provide readme for TA.
* In addition, hardcopy of report without code to me in the class.

**Complexity analysis and runtime evaluation:**
